# Teacha

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 

While the number of teachers has continually increased over the years, studies from recent years show that an average of 20% of educators of color are leaving the teaching profession because they feel undervalued. Research has shown that the lack of diversity among the teaching faculty has negative effects on high-school completion, discipline rates, and test scores for students of color. Additionally, the absence of a role model of a minority teacher prevents students from having diverse learning experiences that will shape and build their knowledge of the world around them. 


## SUMMARY 

Based on the research conducted by our team, teachers of color indicated that oftentimes they are assigned additional roles based on their race and ethnicity such as being responsible for “tough” students of color, or playing a role of a Behavior Dean, in which they are not prepared for. The extra work they receive is not valued by their peers and school administrators which is the primary reason teachers of color identify when asked why they are leave their profession. Our research also showed that teachers of color often work in racially isolated schools – among predominant white teachers and staff - which leads them to feel excluded from their peers/administrators and unwelcomed in their workplace. 

Teacha is a web-based platform created with the goal of empowering teachers of color through a group mentoring model. This web application points struggling and discouraged teachers of color to mentorship-based learning groups tailored to address their career interests and needs. 

We are committed to developing a safe and welcoming online platform for teachers of color to creating meaningful connections with their peers through a group-based mentoring model. 

  

## GOALS  

Our goal is to provide a platform for teachers of color to create meaningful experiences and connections with other teachers of color around the United States in a place of support and value to empower and retain the workforce of current teachers of color in the teaching profession. 

* Support and value - in the effort to build a feeling of value and appreciation, our goal is to create a platform where teachers from all levels can provide mutual support on topics of interest. 

* Increase connections – mentorship relationships can be rich and rewarding for the person being mentored and for the mentor themselves. The goal of the platform is to allow members to expand their network by connecting to other individuals who share similar experiences & background.  

* Meaningful experiences – our goal is to provide a platform for support and career enrichment, where users can share their knowledge and help each other identify opportunities in their career.

## USER STORIES 

Maria, in her 20's, has 5 years of teaching experience (She experiences workplace conflict) 

What feature this covers: logging in, searching for a mentoring circle, joining a mentoring circle, meeting a mentor. 

Maria is a Hispanic teacher at a public elementary school in Texas. She is the only teacher of color in her school. She worked on a presentation to show to her colleagues during professional development that happens at her school before the school year starts. One of the teachers felt that Maria’s presentation was an attack on his ability to teach students of color, and he shared his view with students in the classroom. Maria goes to the administration to address the issue, but she doesn’t receive any support from them. Instead they turn her to the union to file a complaint. Since Maria was lodging her complaint against a tenured teacher, the union offers no help. Maria notices a lack of support in her work. She opens the web-app and after logging in, she goes to the search page to look for a mentoring circle. She finds one called “How to cope with workspace conflict”, that has teachers not only from Texas but also from other parts of the US. Maria joins the mentoring circle. There, she meets Eva, a Hispanic teacher that has 15 years of experience teaching at elementary schools and is the administrator of the mentoring circle. Eva shares some of her expertise on how to deal with conflicts at work, what are some of the approaches she has taken before that helped her and some tips on what teachers of color can do to take care of themselves. Maria feels empowered and confident to go back to work. Now, she has met someone that has the same background as her, that has been though similar experiences and can support her through the process. 


William, in his 40’s, has 17 years of teaching experience (He wants to switch grades) 

What feature this covers: logging in, accessing a mentoring circle, finding participant, connecting with a person. 

William is an African American teacher at a public middle school in California. He is currently teaching seventh grade and he is interested in moving to teach high schoolers. He is comfortable with the work he has. However, he wants to try something new. He schedules a meeting with the principal of his school to get some advice. The principal tells William that unfortunately there isn’t a position available at the high school level at their school, which meant that William would have to look for a position at a different school. The principal tells him that in this case he couldn’t help him. William leaves the meeting and he remembers that last week he met a participant - from one of the mentoring circles he is part of - that had successfully switched grades. He goes to his classroom where he has a computer; He logs into the website and after logging in he looks for the mentoring circle he attended last week.

## COMPETITOR SWOT ANALYSIS 

#### STRENGTHS
* Focus on teachers of color 
* Easy to navigate  
* A safe place where teachers feel like they don’t have to fit in because of their culture. Through messaging & mentor circles (inclusiveness) 
* More personalized, individual connections and interaction between teachers, creating meaningful relationships. 
* Large and small communication groups for both broad and targeted communication reach 
* Our website makes it easy for teachers of color to find mentors. 

#### WEAKNESSES 
* Don't support the group message. 
* Less resources because other established websites have more resources. 
* Much smaller (final) potential target audience(yet).  
* Focus only on US teachers 
* Some things aren’t clear which might confuse users. Don’t have features such as contacting us/mission/purpose... yet.  

#### OPPORTUNITIES 
* No existing website is dedicated only to teachers of color. 
* It could be the only one in the market where teachers can have face-to-face interactions across all their networks. 
* Targeted audience that feels “unappreciated” and wants a medium to be recognized and heard. 

#### THREATS 
* Personalized platforms using AI 
* Promoting the teacher's engagement, making sure they find value in devoting their extra time. 
* Established companies like LinkedIn and Mentor Modules can create a similar feature on their platform and use their existing network to take our target audience away. 

## FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES 

* Product Specific Opportunities (Long-term): 

    * Mentoring Forum: 

        Integrate a forum/thread discussion board in the mentoring circle page to allow for user more communication and 	Q/A answering type of responses.  

    * Resources Page: 

        Implement a page dedicated to resources using internal and external resources integration to offer helpful materials 	for teachers. 

    * Instant/Direct Messaging:  

        Incorporate some sort of instant/direct messaging so users can communicate on a 1:1 basis.  

    * Open/Private Group:

        Allowing mentoring administrators to limit group size, and option to make the mentoring circle group open or private. 

* Facilitate in-person personal development conferences: 

    * These conferences would be advertised on our platform and have an in-person attendance cost. This would allow Teacha to be in both the virtual and in-person marketplace for teacher personal development. An incentive for teachers attending these conferences could be Teacha providing grants for top presenters or active members in the conference.   

* Revenue Model: 

    * Talent Solutions/Recruitment: In the future Teacha can provide in demand talent recruitment for teachers of color or 		organizations that need teachers of color.  

    * Targeted Marketing: Teacha can gain revenue by allowing companies to advertise on the userbase.  

    * Personal Development Training: Teacha can host paid personal development sessions and mentorship on its platform.

### APPENDIX: 

## USER INTERVIEWS 

Jane, in Her 50's, has 24 years of teaching experience. 

Jane is a 6th grade teacher at a public elementary school in the Miami School district. She spends most of her time trying to figure out new technology implemented by her school or preparing materials for her class.  In her classroom, she faces multiple challenges she doesn’t know how to solve such as: 1) Interacting with students that have emotional struggles, 2) Managing an overwhelming teaching schedule, 3) Finding resources to connect with other teachers, 4) Improving student to student communication 5) And finding good resources to supplement her teaching curriculum. Amy uses technology mainly to teach classes as all her student uses laptop to submit assignments. She copes with her mental stress by going for walks and meditating. She is eager to learn new technology to collaborate and connect with her students to improve both teacher and student success. 

Robert, in his late 40’s, has 16 years of teaching experience. 

Robert is a 2nd grade teacher at a public elementary school in Tacoma School district. He is very affectionate with his students. He focuses on kids' success and teaches them about the feeling of be loved and cared for rather than focusing on a child’s success by a letter or a number grade. He experienced hardship and went through a hard time when his student with a disability passed away 2 years go and he has trouble looking after himself when it comes to coping with emotional stress. Also, Robert’s school has recently hired a new principal who focuses on data-driven student results which conflicts with his teaching method. For professional development, he stays after school twice a week to collaborate with other teachers but at the same time he feels old, worried that he might be replaced because he is not most up to date on teaching methods. Robert is willing to help other teachers and explore new things with easy navigation because he is not too tech savvy.
