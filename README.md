# Teacha

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 

While the number of teachers has continually increased over the years, studies from recent years show that an average of 20% of educators of color are leaving the teaching profession because they feel undervalued. Research has shown that the lack of diversity among the teaching faculty has negative effects on high-school completion, discipline rates, and test scores for students of color. Additionally, the absence of a role model of a minority teacher prevents students from having diverse learning experiences that will shape and build their knowledge of the world around them. 


## SUMMARY 

Based on the research conducted by our team, teachers of color indicated that oftentimes they are assigned additional roles based on their race and ethnicity such as being responsible for “tough” students of color, or playing a role of a Behavior Dean, in which they are not prepared for. The extra work they receive is not valued by their peers and school administrators which is the primary reason teachers of color identify when asked why they are leave their profession. Our research also showed that teachers of color often work in racially isolated schools – among predominant white teachers and staff - which leads them to feel excluded from their peers/administrators and unwelcomed in their workplace. 

Teacha is a web-based platform created with the goal of empowering teachers of color through a group mentoring model. This web application points struggling and discouraged teachers of color to mentorship-based learning groups tailored to address their career interests and needs. 

We are committed to developing a safe and welcoming online platform for teachers of color to creating meaningful connections with their peers through a group-based mentoring model. 

  

## GOALS  

Our goal is to provide a platform for teachers of color to create meaningful experiences and connections with other teachers of color around the United States in a place of support and value to empower and retain the workforce of current teachers of color in the teaching profession. 

* Support and value - in the effort to build a feeling of value and appreciation, our goal is to create a platform where teachers from all levels can provide mutual support on topics of interest. 

* Increase connections – mentorship relationships can be rich and rewarding for the person being mentored and for the mentor themselves. The goal of the platform is to allow members to expand their network by connecting to other individuals who share similar experiences & background.

Maria is a Hispanic teacher at a public elementary school in Texas. She is the only teacher of color in her school.

## USER INTERVIEWS 

Jane, in Her 50's, has 24 years of teaching experience. 

Jane is a 6th grade teacher at a public elementary school in the Miami School district. She spends most of her time trying to figure out new technology implemented by her school or preparing materials for her class.  In her classroom, she faces multiple challenges she doesn’t know how to solve such as: 1) Interacting with students that have emotional struggles, 2) Managing an overwhelming teaching schedule, 3) Finding resources to connect with other teachers, 4) Improving student to student communication 5) And finding good resources to supplement her teaching curriculum. Amy uses technology mainly to teach classes as all her student uses laptop to submit assignments. She copes with her mental stress by going for walks and meditating. She is eager to learn new technology to collaborate and connect with her students to improve both teacher and student success. 

Robert, in his late 40’s, has 16 years of teaching experience. 

Robert is a 2nd grade teacher at a public elementary school in Tacoma School district. He is very affectionate with his students. He focuses on kids' success and teaches them about the feeling of be loved and cared for rather than focusing on a child’s success by a letter or a number grade. He experienced hardship and went through a hard time when his student with a disability passed away 2 years go and he has trouble looking after himself when it comes to coping with emotional stress. Also, Robert’s school has recently hired a new principal who focuses on data-driven student results which conflicts with his teaching method. For professional development, he stays after school twice a week to collaborate with other teachers but at the same time he feels old, worried that he might be replaced because he is not most up to date on teaching methods. Robert is willing to help other teachers and explore new things with easy navigation because he is not too tech savvy.
