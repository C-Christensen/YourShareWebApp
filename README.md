# YourShareWebApp
### YourShare is a copy of a lending website project

YourShare enables individuals to open what they have to their circles. Lenders can post items for sharing and borrowers can find what they need to get a job done. Have a car that you don't drive daily? Have a blender you only use sometime? Post these items and let others share value in what you own. Need a weed wacker to cleanup the block? Check out YourShare to see if a neighbor can chip in. YourShare starts with individuals and grows into a community lending library.
